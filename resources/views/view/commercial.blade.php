            <h3 class="text-heading">Annual Percentage Yield</h3>
            <p class="sample-text">
				Your annual percentage yield, also known as APY, is the amount of interest your account earns in a year. 
              	When you sign up for a new savings account, it's important to know the APY offered since it can have a 
              	big impact on how much money your savings earn.
            </p>
          <h3 class="text-heading">Balance:</h3>
            <p class="sample-text">
 				Your balance is the amount of money you have in your savings account. 
              	It will change depending on if you withdraw cash, 
              	make additional contributions or accrue interest on what's in the account
              	</br>Appnomu often requires a minimum opening deposit, 
              	which acts as your balance for the length of the saving term with no additional contributions.
					</br>
				Most brick-and-mortar savings accounts require making a minimum deposit to open an account. 
              	Some high-yield savings accounts may require that you make a minimum deposit to open, 
              	as well as maintain a minimum balance to earn interest.

            </p>
          <h3 class="text-heading">Appnomu  ladder</h3>
            <p class="sample-text">
				When you put your money in Appnomu, you earn a fixed interest rate for a specific amount of time on that initial deposit. 		
              	You can't withdraw your money or make additional contributions (without penalty) until that time is up, so your money is essentially locked away. 
            </p>
          <h3 class="text-heading">Saving  term length</h3>
            <p class="sample-text">
				The amount of time your money sits in a savings account before you can touch it. 
              	Savings  term lengths range between, one month, three months, six months and one year, 
              	and usually the longer the term, the higher the APY you earn.
            </p>
			<h3 class="text-heading">Early withdrawal penalty</h3>
            <p class="sample-text">
				Typically, you can't access your money before your savings term ends, or you'll get hit with an early withdrawal penalty. The penalty fees can vary depending on your savings and your savings term length, but it's usually the interest earned, or the interest that you would have earned, over a certain number of days or months.
            </p>
			<h3 class="text-heading">Fixed APY</h3>
            <p class="sample-text">
				A fixed APY does not change. Whereas brick-and-mortar and high-yield savings offer variable APYs, Appnomu offer account holders a fixed APY that they are locked into for the duration of their saving term.
            </p>
			<h3 class="text-heading">Grace period</h3>
            <p class="sample-text">
				A grace period is the amount of days after a saving  term ends where users can either withdraw their funds or deposit more money into their account penalty-free.
			</p>	
			<h3 class="text-heading">Maturity date</h3>
            <p class="sample-text">
				The maturity date is the date that your Savings term ends. At this point when the term length is over, savers can withdraw their funds penalty-free. The money they get back includes their initial deposit, plus the interest earned over time. If you don't need the money, you can also renew the saving  term for the same amount of time or transfer it to a new saving plan
			</p>
			<h3 class="text-heading">Mobile deposit</h3>
            <p class="sample-text">
				Instead of going to the bank to deposit a check, you can use your mobile app to save and have the funds immediately deposited into your account. It can sometimes take a day or two for the funds to be accessible.
